### Level 3

We now have some reporting and we are ready to start the next feature. 
The final goal is to "watch" a directory and upload every file in this directory.
Normal webpages are not allowed to "watch" directory, so we have to build a desktop app to access the system, with node-webkit (https://nwjs.io/).

* Setup node-webkit
* Integrate your app with node-webkit
