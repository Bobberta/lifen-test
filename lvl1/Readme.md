### Context

You are working for a company which aims to provide better communication between doctors, and the first product of this company involves sending medical reports between practitioners.

This company wants to build a base API for many apps with easy interoperability, so the backend team built the API with a standard called FHIR (https://www.hl7.org/fhir).

The goal of this challenge is to build a small webapp with this standard that will upload a document and give some reporting to the user.

### General guidelines 

* You can use any framework you like.
* The app should look ok. It should be usable (have a decent UX and UI).

### Level 1

The goal is to create a small interface to drop a document.

* A drop zone should be present on the page
* When the user drop a document, the webpage should display the filename.
